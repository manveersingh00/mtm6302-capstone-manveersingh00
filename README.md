# Quiz Web Application
## Project Overview
The Quiz Web Application is designed to provide users with random quiz questions based on their selected difficulty level or category. Users can answer questions. The application tracks the number of correct and incorrect answers and allows users to reset their statistics. There is also a 1-minute timer in each question, so if the user does not take any action, the quiz automatically completes after repeated 10 questions.
